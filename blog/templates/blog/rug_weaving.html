            A Rich History
        </h4>
        <p class="h6 text-justify text-gold-muted">
            The roots of Persian rug weaving stretch back over 2,500 years. The earliest known example, the Pazyryk carpet, dates to the 5th century BCE and was discovered in a Siberian burial mound. This ancient piece showcases the sophistication of early Persian weavers, highlighting complex patterns and high-quality materials that have become synonymous with Persian rugs.

            The Evolution of Design
        </h4>
        <p class="h6 text-justify text-gold-muted">
            Throughout history, Persian rug designs have evolved, influenced by various dynasties and cultural shifts. The Islamic Golden Age (8th to 13th centuries) introduced geometric patterns and floral motifs, reflecting the aesthetic principles of Islamic art. This period also saw the establishment of weaving centers in cities such as Kerman, Tabriz, and Kashan, each developing its unique style. <br>
            The Safavid Dynasty (1501-1736) marked a golden era for Persian rug weaving. Under the patronage of Shah Abbas I, royal workshops produced some of the most exquisite rugs known for their elaborate designs and use of luxurious materials like silk and gold thread. These rugs often featured intricate floral patterns, hunting scenes, and elaborate medallions, representing the height of Persian artistic achievement.

            Techniques and Craftsmanship
        </h4>
        <p class="h6 text-justify text-gold-muted">
            The creation of a Persian rug is a labor-intensive process that can take months or even years to complete. The journey begins with selecting high-quality materials, typically wool, silk, or a blend of both. Natural dyes derived from plants, insects, and minerals are used to create the vibrant colors that characterize Persian rugs. <br>
            The weaving process itself involves setting up a loom and meticulously hand-knotting each thread. The knots, known as Persian knots or Senneh knots, are tied individually, creating a dense and durable fabric. The design is often drawn on a cartoon—a detailed blueprint of the rug's pattern—guiding the weaver through the intricate process.

            Symbolism and Meaning
        </h4>
        <p class="h6 text-justify text-gold-muted">
            Persian rugs are rich in symbolism, with each design element carrying specific meanings. Common motifs include flowers, birds, and geometric shapes, each representing different aspects of life and nature. For instance, the boteh (paisley) symbolizes fertility and eternal life, while the lotus flower represents purity and spiritual enlightenment. These symbols turn each rug into a narrative piece, telling stories of Persian culture, history, and beliefs.
